### Features:

 - _Real-time Exploration_: Navigate the Mandelbrot set in real-time using arrow keys.

 - _Dynamic Zoom_: Zoom in and out to discover the fractal's infinite complexity.

 - _ASCII Rendering_: Visualize the Mandelbrot set using a variety of ASCII characters, creating a retro-style graphical representation.

 - _Color Support_: Utilizes terminal colors to enhance the visual experience and highlight fractal details.

 - _Adjustable Pan Speed_: Dynamically change the navigation speed while exploring.

 - _Performance Optimized_: Efficient calculations allow for smooth navigation even on lower-end systems.

### Technical Details:

 - Written in C++ using the `ncurses` library for terminal manipulation.

 - Employs the `complex` number library for precise Mandelbrot set calculations.

 - Implements a custom color palette system for vibrant visualizations.

 - Uses ASCII character sets to represent different "depth" levels in the fractal.
